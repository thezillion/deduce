Watson: Sherlock, how many more riddles is this psycho going to ask? Wait, before that, how is he still alive!!!

Sherlock: He is dead. My best guess is he had a devotional successor to take up the mantle and continue his legacy forward

Watson: You mean, a Moriarty Jnr? Who would possibly adore him?

Sherlock: Getting followers won’t be hard if Moriarty shares his secrets and intellects. My doubt is how was he certain this guy would not mess up his work over the years and destroy his framework? That certainly must have been quite some trust.

Watson:  Wonder how long the two were together to understand personalities better. A year? 5 years? Maybe since birth?

Sherlock: Watson, it is not a twin. Moriarty does not have a twin. That was the one detail I had to beg from my brother to be certain.

Watson: Alright. So now we have a successor ? What if it’s an army of human minds working as a team to take on his criminal consultation profession?

Sherlock: That too is possible. As much as I hate to say it, I’ll have to meet Mycroft in person and discuss about this impediment. Wonder if he is free though.

Watson: But Moriarty warned us from that right? If he finds out…

Sherlock: If Moriarty has already infiltrated the government agency and Mycroft’s room, Olympus has already fallen. I surely have nothing to lose in that case. Okay then, let me catch the next tube to the capital. Will continue his game on the go. You better get back to the hospital soon. Say Hi to Mary will you?
