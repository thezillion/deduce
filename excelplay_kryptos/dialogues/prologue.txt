Sherlock: Oh Watson, what a boring week it has been. Burglary and Identity Thefts, from stolen money to missing residents. Nothing keeps me engaged beyond 4 hours.

Watson: Sherlock, you have not slept the last 3 days. If you’re bored why not just do that? What is keeping you awake? Besides, we should be happy nothing bad is happening.

Sherlock: Nothing bad is being “reported”. You cannot  believe everything you hear Doctor. We spring up for action only when someone walks in through that door. But if they never make it there to begin with, we have not done our act of justice.

Watson: So you’re staying up awake to watch the neighbourhood? Just set up cameras and get some sleep. Come on Detective, use those brains and take some rest.

Sherlock: Oh my! I almost forgot about the half brain I left in the fridge to analyze. Maybe sometime tonight.

Watson: Are you serious? How many times …

BEEP

Sherlock: We have a message on our website. Another fan message ? Someone go get these kids some comics and keep them quiet.

Watson: Let me check… What’s the passcode again? 221B?

Sherlock: Maybe. You’re the one who comes up with these hilarious codes. Didn’t you pick that up from the military?

Watson: Sherlock, it is him.

Sherlock: My brother Mycroft? How many times have I told him to …

Watson: No, It is from Jim Moriarty.

Sherlock: …. Must be someone just messing around with us

Watson: I doubt it. You should read this

Subject: Greetings from the grave, Sherlock

Em SsIm UoY dId ?
SH,
It took me some time to figure out the best way to get to you.

My dead skeleton at your doorstep?
An explosion note at the centre of the nation?
Or even better, kidnap Watson (again) and get you to find me?

In the end, I decided digital approach is the way to go. I know you’re bored, deep inside, of these petty case, for there is just so little chaos the world can offer. You were the reason why I decided to leave the world, just to watch you burn alive.

But how does someone from the grave watch the world?
How does the past admire the future?
How am I still breathing?

You might find this hilarious or extremely horrifying, but I have found a way to cheat death. People thought all those Norse mythology with the tree of life was all but a myth, but for me that was a path to discover meaningful afterlife.

So Sherlock, even if you cannot see me in flesh and blood, I assure you the stakes are very real. You faked your death, yet found a way out. My escape is way more elegant.

I owe you a good game. A much better version. Something you need to deduce.
I am an immortal, and so am back to strike a deal.

Solve all the riddles I offer you next, and I will tell you what I really have become.
Remember, I can forgive your errors, but I cannot wait forever. So once the clock starts ticking, you will see the shimmering light fade away gradually. Will you make it out before that? Only time can tell.

Try to route back to me, and you’ll get lost in transmission. Call the cops, and I assure you things won’t go well, darling. Even if your big brother Mycroft comes to rescue you, the repercussions great London faces will be catastrophic.

So if you’re up to the game, let us begin.

XOXO

JM

Watson: What do we do, Sherlock? Is this fake?

Sherlock: Moriarty is dead, all roads lead to this fact. But if this is real, I am curious to know who is behind the mask. Besides, if insomnia is hitting me, might as well play along with his tides.

And so, this is how it all began
